Welcome to my corner of the web! Allow me to take you on a journey through my life and passions.



## The Beginning: A Love for Learning



From a young age, I've always been fascinated by the world of computers. Growing up in Aligarh, I was the kid who loved to tinker with gadgets and dive deep into the mysteries of technology. My formal education began at **CBSE Delhi**, where I completed my **Secondary School** with a perfect 10 CGPA in 2017. This set the stage for my future endeavors.


## The Academic Journey



Determined to pursue my passion for technology, I joined **Aligarh Muslim University** for my higher education. My academic journey here has been both challenging and rewarding:


- **Senior Secondary School** (2017 – 2019): I excelled with a score of 76.4%, building a strong foundation in science and technology.
- **Bachelor of Computer Application** (2019 – 2022): I deepened my knowledge with a CGPA of 8.1, diving into the world of programming, algorithms, and software development.
- **Master of Computer Application** (2023 – Present): Currently, I am further honing my skills with a CGPA of 8.6, working on advanced projects and research.


## Diving into the World of Code



My journey through the realm of programming languages and developer tools has been nothing short of exhilarating. From mastering **PHP, Python, SQL, Java, C, and C++** to embracing modern web technologies like **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ReactJs)**, I've continuously sought to expand my technical toolkit.


## Projects: Turning Ideas into Reality



### AMU PYQ Papers

In March 2024, I created a dynamic web application for students to access previous year question papers. This project employed **HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, PHP, and OOPs**, providing a seamless user experience and robust admin review features.



### Currently-Playing on Spotify

In January 2024, I developed an interactive script using **Spotify API, JSON, JavaScript, Ajax, and PHP**. This script displays the currently playing Spotify track without reloading the entire page, integrating seamlessly with web pages for real-time music updates.



### Personal Web Terminal

August 2023 saw the creation of my personalized web terminal using **Vanilla JavaScript**. This terminal offers a range of commands for information and interaction, leveraging APIs for dynamic data fetching.


### Blog Web App

In November 2023, I built a blog web app using **JavaScript and PHP**. This app enables easy blog CRUD operations, complete with a login/signup feature, contact section, and an exclusive admin panel for managing queries and feedback.


### Covisurance

December 2022 marked the development of Covisurance, an automated health process platform using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and APIs**. This project streamlined online applications, payments, and claims, with enhanced security features and user-friendly interfaces.



## Certifications and Workshops: Constantly Learning

I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and self-improvement. Over the years, I've earned several certifications:


- **The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert** (June 2024)
- **Google Cloud Study Jams Labs Certificate** (Feb 2024)
- **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** (Feb 2024)
- **The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp** (Jan 2024)
- **Geodata Processing Using Python** (Jan 2023)


I've also participated in various workshops to keep my skills sharp:



- "Introduction to Research Practices" (Nov 18-21, 2023)
- "Cyber Security: Pen Testing Methodology" (Nov 4-10, 2023)
- "CS360: Bits to Bots" (Oct 9-14, 2023)


## Beyond the Code: Hobbies and Interests



While technology is my passion, I have a rich tapestry of interests that color my life. Music is a constant companion, with genres like **Dream Pop, Shoegaze, Ambient Pop, Slowcore, and Indie Rock** being my favorites. I also enjoy **2000s Bollywood** and **Ghazal** music occasionally, with artists like **Eminem, 2Pac, Biggie**, and indie talents like **Yawar, Abdal, and Alisethi** filling my playlists.



Fitness is another important aspect of my life, as I believe a healthy body fosters a sharp mind. When I'm not coding or working out, you'll find me immersed in books, exploring the worlds crafted by authors like **Fyodor Dostoevsky** and **Haruki Murakami**.



My curiosity extends beyond Earth, as I am deeply interested in space research, particularly artificial satellites and the mysteries of the Moon and Mars.

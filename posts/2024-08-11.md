Hey there, fellow wanderers of the web! Shuja here, back from the wild ride of summer break and ready to dive headfirst into the thrilling chaos of hostel life and final year classes. It’s been quite the adventure, and I’m here to spill the beans on what I’ve been up to and what lies ahead.

<br>

## Summer Break Shenanigans

<br>

Ah, summer break. That glorious stretch of time where we can pretend that the real world doesn’t exist, only to realize, as it comes to an end, that we’ve wasted it all binge-watching shows and avoiding productive tasks. But not for me! Well, at least not entirely. 

<br>

I kicked off my summer with a bang by diving into **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**. Yes, you read that right. I spent my summer holiday learning Python so thoroughly that even my pet hamster started to question if I was secretly training for a career as a tech wizard. Spoiler alert: I’m not.

<br>

Next up was the **AMU PYQ Papers** project. This little gem of a project transformed into a dynamic web application where students could access previous year question papers with the ease of a click. I got so into it that I started dreaming in HTML and PHP. 

<br>

Oh, and did I mention the internship at a company in Noida? I spent my time there developing a CRM system, which means I spent many a sleepless night solving coding problems and trying to look productive in front of a screen. Who knew customer relationship management could be so... well, managing?

<br>

## Back to the Hostel: Let the Madness Begin

<br>

Now, as the summer break comes to a close, I’m back in the hostel. It’s like returning to a reality show where the WiFi is unpredictable, the laundry situation is a constant source of drama, and the kitchen is a culinary battlefield. But hey, the thrill of hostel life is unbeatable!

<br>

## Final Year Feels

<br>

As I step into the third semester of my Master’s program, I’m buzzing with excitement (and a touch of anxiety). My final year is packed with juicy subjects: Artificial Intelligence, Theory of Computation, Software Engineering, Networking, and a mini-project. I’m especially pumped about diving deep into **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. Because, let’s face it, solving complex problems is way more fun than actually getting enough sleep.

<br>

## What’s Next?

<br>

With the summer’s projects under my belt and the final year’s challenges ahead, I’m ready to tackle it all with a mix of enthusiasm and sarcasm. Here’s to a semester of coding marathons, caffeine-fueled study sessions, and the occasional existential crisis about where the last two years have disappeared.

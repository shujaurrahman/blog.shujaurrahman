                        <h1>How to Use Two GitHub Accounts on a Macbook the Right Way</h1>
                        <div>
                            <p>Recently, I joined HeadshotPro as a full-stack developer, completed my onboarding, and
                                received an invitation to their GitHub organization. The catch? It was sent to my new
                                email address, which was perfectly fine, except that I had already linked my personal
                                GitHub account to my Macbook, which I use a lot, since I make a lot of side projects and
                                some open-source contributions as well.</p>
                            <p>Now, I faced two options: either create a new user on my Macbook for my work or use my
                                existing user and add a new GitHub account to it. However, it wasn't that
                                straightforward.</p>
                            <p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/akshara_dev" rel="nofollow">Akshara Hegde</a>
                                advised me to create a new SSH key and link it to my work GitHub account. He also
                                suggested creating terminal aliases to switch between my personal and work GitHub
                                accounts. While this method worked, it meant running a script each time I needed to
                                switch, which was far from ideal. Here's what it looked like:</p>
                            <pre class="language-bash shiki shiki-themes github-dark"><code><span class="line" line="1"><span style="--shiki-default: #F97583;">alias</span><span style="--shiki-default: #E1E4E8;"> git_personal</span><span style="--shiki-default: #F97583;">=</span><span style="--shiki-default: #9ECBFF;">"(ssh-agent) &amp;&amp; ssh-add ~/.ssh/personal"
</span></span><span class="line" line="2"><span style="--shiki-default: #F97583;">alias</span><span style="--shiki-default: #E1E4E8;"> git_work</span><span style="--shiki-default: #F97583;">=</span><span style="--shiki-default: #9ECBFF;">"(ssh-agent) &amp;&amp; ssh-add ~/.ssh/work"
</span></span></code></pre>
                            <p>This meant that whenever I wanted to work on my personal projects, I had to run
                                git_personal, and for work, it was git_work.</p>
                            <p>I also found some other complicated solutions that involved SSH configs with different
                                hostnames meant specifically for respective repositories.</p>
                            <h3 id="the-solution"><a href="#the-solution">The solution</a></h3>
                            <p>There had to be a better way, and I discovered that I could use conditional statements in
                                my global .gitconfig file.</p>
                            <p>The first step was to add the SSH key to my work GitHub account and create a folder named
                                work. Any Git command or operation executed in this folder would automatically use my
                                work credentials.</p>
                            <h3 id="how-does-it-work"><a href="#how-does-it-work">How does it work?</a></h3>
                            <p>Your existing .gitconfig file likely looks like this:</p>

                            <p>That's it! Now, when you run any Git command in your Work folder, it will automatically
                                use your work credentials, while in other locations, it will use your personal
                                credentials.</p>
                            <h3 id="how-do-we-test-this"><a href="#how-do-we-test-this">How do we test this?</a></h3>
                            <p>Navigate to your work directory repositories and run the following command to check if
                                it's using your work credentials:</p>

                            <p>This command will only work if the folder you are running it in is a Git repository.</p>
                            <br>
